## Contributing
Feel free to send a pull a request for anything. Here are a list of features that I would love to see added:

+ **User List**: Get a list of users from the config files and push them to the client on new connection.
+ **Basic Login**: If a user is not found in the config file, pop a lightbox and ask for their user name, then save it to the file
+ **Links**:
    + Render html links as actual links on the page
    + Enable drag and drop links
+ **Images**:
    + Enable drag and drop images
+ **Code Review**: Add a check box to enable code review mode, where you can paste code and have it rendered pre-formatted
+ **Styling Updates**:
    + Use alternate colors for alternate message rows
    + Make the page responsive
